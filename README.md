## Purpose
The purpose of my website is to showcase my skills, hobbies & work experience to prospective dev employers. It is to also show the commitment and passion I have towards pursuing a professional role as a full stack web developer or eventually becoming a back end developer. It is also to show the proficient amount of knowledge in HTML & CSS I have learnt in the past few weeks, although not perfect I soon hope to be and if not soon then eventually. One way or another.

## How components and styling will engage the audience
### Use of coolors colour kit
- With the synergy of certain colours mixed with coolors, the colour scheme for the website will be much more attractive and captivating to the viewing eye. The colours blue and yellow help contrast each other by complimentary color harmony as they are opposites on the color wheel. These colours envoke peaceful and joyful emotions.  
### Use of box shadows 
- The use of box shadows for containers holding text components in my websites helps attract attention to the area of concern for viewers to engage with.   
### Use of Animated Icons  
- Animated Icons were implemented to add a touch of interactivity with the user for a greater user experience. Although the user cannot physically interact with the icons, there is a visual interaction aspect.  
### Use of Horizontal Lines 
- The use of horizontal lines is added to help users distinguish different sections of the page and divide content.  
### Background Colors/Images  
- The use of background colours/images for text components helps with readability of text when used in conjunction with complimentary colours.  
### Use of line-height, font-size, word-spacing, font-family, letter-spacing 
- For readability purposes all the mentioned properties were set to the recommended sizes. This makes reading the document easier.
### Contact Page Form
- Contact Page is a form that can be filled by the visitor or viewer for any enquiries or employment opportunities for me
### Blog links listed or through read more button
- Blog Posts can be accessed by clicking the read more button or click the individual blog links. Each link will redirect the user to a specific blog post in which users may read about interesting topics relating to web development.

## Decision making process relating to aesthetic of my website
- **Structuring the design of my website**  
My decision making process relating to the aesthetic of my website revolved around the use of coolors
and wireframes. I first started with structuring the HTML skeleton using wireframes to design the layout of the website at different breakpoints. I used Coolors to select the colour scheme for the overall presentation of the website deciding on both the primary and secondary colours and any shades of the two.
- **BreakPoints**  
I decided on how my website would look at varying breakpoints. I began to style my website at width: 400px using the inspect component on google chrome browser at 100% zoom. I decided to have my website change its orientation and display at (min-width: 992px) for tablets and (min-width: 1200px) for desktops.
- **Breakpoints used**     
Mobile: min-width: 450px;  
Tablet: min-width: 992px;  
Desktop: min-width: 1200px;
